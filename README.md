**Minesweeper Game**

Description
This project is a simple Minesweeper game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It features a grid of cells that can either contain a mine or be safe. Players reveal the cells trying to avoid mines. The game ends when all non-mine cells are revealed or a mine is clicked.

**Running the Game**

To start the game, navigate to the directory containing the game files in your terminal and run:
python3 main.py

Customizable grid size and mine count through settings.py.
